" TODO:
"
" More structure
"
" - backslash escapes within strings:
"    - \" \$ in double quotes
"    - \u{123456} in J8-style strings
"
" - Is there way to understand recursion like ${a:-'foo'}?  Or just leave that
"   out
" - There is also recursion of $(hostname) and such.
"
" - Here docs?  They are hard, could leave them out of YSH
